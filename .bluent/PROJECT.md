# Bluent Project Status

This file is the current project-state entry point. Historical sprint/relaunch detail that previously accumulated here is preserved in [`PROJECT-HISTORY-2026-08-29.md`](PROJECT-HISTORY-2026-08-29.md) and in the versioned sprint plans under `.bluent/sprints/`.

## Parallel v3 foundation (isolated development)

**Epic:** [#416](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/issues/416), all work in the protected `bluent-v3` integration branch and issue-specific task branches. **Stable `Dev`, NuGet and deployments remain untouched.**

**#417 CSS architecture:** [ADR D1–D5 accepted 2026-10-11](../docs/v3/architecture/ADR-0001-styling-boundaries.md), [PR #498](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/pull/498) merged into **`bluent-v3` only** (squash `3988195e`), GitHub Project **Done**, issue closed. [Browser CSS probe](../scripts/quality/probe_v3_consumer_css_overrides.py), [published SSR smoke](../scripts/quality/probe_v3_ssr_publish.ps1) and [migration compatibility risks](../docs/v3/architecture/css-migration-impact-ledger.md) underpin the accepted architectural direction. This does **not** approve exact final #418 token names, general Fluent parity or runtime accessibility.

**#419 editable design library:** [Review PR #499](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/pull/499) contains an independent project-owned `Bluent v3 Design System` Penpot file and verifiable linked Fluent source/library research. The imported `Microsoft Fluent 2 Web (Community)` remains read-only. [Working Penpot manifest](../docs/v3/design/penpot-workspace.manifest.json): 27 editable pages, 65 core native variants + 16 research fixtures and alignment/RTL/size stress evidence. Issue #419 remains **Review**, not Done; accept/merge only to `bluent-v3` following review.

**#418 token system:** Next foundation task after acceptance of D1–D5. Must enter Ready only after design-first, source-to-token mapping and 10-brand Light/Dark/RTL/high-contrast acceptance goals are traceable. Token/brand decisions and implementation require a dedicated `v3/issue-418-...` branch and PR.

**Design rule:** use [Penpot first / Figma authorized fallback](../docs/v3/PENPOT-WORKFLOW.md), record real design file/page/variant IDs in relevant issue/PR. The original [Microsoft Fluent 2 Web Figma reference](https://www.figma.com/design/UxJ11V0c8TI8aaSVpdKeQD) must not be edited. Independent editable [Bluent v3 architecture Figma research](https://www.figma.com/design/JfxkDgSbNr8W0ppUZPQPHc?node-id=14-3) is supplementary, not final font/token/browser design sign-off.

**GitHub workflow:** [Backlog → Ready → In progress → Review → Done](../docs/v3/ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md). No task automatically merges to `Dev` before the complete v3 epic is accepted and separately authorized.

**#552 retrospective Fluent parity audit (parallel, evidence-only):** [18-family matrix](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-RETRO-AUDIT.md), [Wave A API review (82 occurrences)](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-WAVE-A-API-REVIEW.md), [Wave B API review (71 occurrences)](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-WAVE-B-API-REVIEW.md), [Wave C API review (40 occurrences)](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-WAVE-C-API-REVIEW.md), and [Wave D API review (46 occurrences)](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-WAVE-D-API-REVIEW.md). All four manual waves now cover 18/18 families and 239 source-known direct/locally inherited parameter occurrences. A new [Blazor extension audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-BLAZOR-EXTENSIONS-AUDIT.md) inventories binding, validation, EventCallback and JavaScript interop for all 18 families; each BlazorExtensions dimension is audited_gaps, not accepted. A [token/theme source audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-TOKEN-THEME-AUDIT.md) now inventories theme-token references and component-local properties across all 18 families; each tokenTheme dimension is audited_gaps, not accepted. A [responsive/RTL source audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-RESPONSIVE-RTL-AUDIT.md) now inventories physical/logical CSS, breakpoints and existing browser evidence for all 18 families; each responsiveRTL dimension is audited_gaps, not accepted. All 18 have selected dark/RTL evidence, but only five have narrow/zoom proxy evidence; zoom-200 is not native browser UI zoom. An [interactive behavior audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-BEHAVIOR-AUDIT.md) now consolidates observed state transitions, known browser failures and remaining acceptance gates across all 18 families; each behavior dimension is audited_gaps, not accepted. An [accessibility semantics audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md) now inventories accessible names, roles, state announcements and native-control semantics across all 18 families; every accessibility dimension is audited_gaps, with native AT/OS contrast still pending. A read-only [Penpot design-artifact audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-DESIGN-ARTIFACT-AUDIT.md) confirms the #552 coverage board has 18 family rows, 239 API entries and 0 approvals; the local library has 13 components but only four family types with dedicated draft design pages/assets, leaving 14 without dedicated family-specific assets in the current snapshot. All remain DESIGN PENDING; the coverage board is not approval. A [visual evidence coverage audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-VISUAL-EVIDENCE-AUDIT.md) links Light/LTR, Dark/RTL and forced-colors evidence for all 18 families, but only five have narrow/zoom proxy evidence; hover-state evidence exists for one family, reduced-motion for three and disabled-state for four. No pixel-diff or complete side-by-side visual comparison has been performed. A [migration-document coverage audit](../docs/v3/quality/FLUENT-PARITY-MIGRATION-DOCS-AUDIT.md) confirms current component references exist for 18/18 families but 0/18 have a populated 2.x-to-v3 migration section; the shared template is not a migration guide. All nine matrix dimensions are now audited_gaps for all 18 families; none is accepted. The refreshed typed-field browser probe passed 47/47 in both Chrome and Edge and reproduced a MaskedField digit-prefix defect plus duplicate DOM IDs in the current fields demo (_timeOnly, _timeSpan, _dateField). These are audit findings only; no product source was changed. No product source, CSS, public API or component design changed. Typed-field browser evidence reports 47/47 checks per engine in Chrome and Edge; control-semantics browser evidence reports 56/56 per engine. The latest full quality suite passed 434/434; Wave B, Wave C and Wave D GitHub CI each passed 3/3 on their respective commits. The Blazor extension, token/theme, responsive/RTL, interactive behavior, accessibility, design-artifact, visual-evidence and migration-doc audits are wired into the same CI workflow. PR #553 remains Draft; all family design approvals remain pending, evidenceBundle remains null, and 0/18 families are Fluent-approved. The Penpot audit coverage board is synchronized at revision 447 under the named draft version; it records coverage only, not design approval. The remaining work is cross-family design/visual/runtime/native-AT acceptance and remediation of confirmed gaps; do not close #552 until the full criteria are satisfied.

## Current Phase

**Phase:** AI readiness and consumer usability
**Current Work:** Issue #406 — canonical Bluent consumer skill
**Status:** Implementation and acceptance evidence complete; PR review-readiness confirmation in progress
**Working Branch:** `docs/issue-406-consumer-skill`
**Pull Request:** [#407](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/pull/407) — Draft pending final evidence-only CI
**Tracking Issue:** [#406](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/issues/406)
**Product/API Gap Backlog:** [#411](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/issues/411)

## Current Outcome

- `.agents/skills/bluent/` provides a portable, retrieval-oriented Bluent-first consumer skill.
- Canonical documentation remains the API/behavior source of truth; the skill is a router rather than a duplicated encyclopedia.
- The source-reconciled consumer inventory contains 65 retrieval families and all 65 are source verified:
  - 57 `Bluent.UI` families;
  - 2 Charts families;
  - 2 Diagrams families;
  - 4 Utilities families.
- `docs/components/consumer-api-surface.md` classifies service/container/helper/configuration APIs separately from ordinary component families.
- `scripts/quality/check_consumer_skill.py` deterministically checks main-UI source/inventory drift, required skill structure, and canonical index routes in Quality CI.
- `samples/Bluent.TaskExamples` contains representative dogfood scenarios, including Tree selection/DnD contracts and Utilities busy-indicator registration/usage.
- `docs/ai/bluent-consumer-skill-dogfood.md` records scenario coverage and runtime boundaries.
- `docs/ai/issue-406-acceptance.md` maps #406 acceptance criteria to repository evidence.
- Product/API/runtime/accessibility defects discovered during verification are tracked in #411 instead of being silently changed in #406.

## Validation State

Quality run #199 and Release packages run #546 both passed on PR head `d6b8176e5e30ee96340344287baf6338e6a55dd0` after the complete implementation, inventory/link reconciliation, dogfood work, project-state refresh, and acceptance audit.

Quality #199 verified:

- tool/solution restore;
- zero-warning Release solution build;
- canonical TaskExamples compilation and the DrawerContent collision negative control;
- consumer-skill coverage/drift validation;
- solution tests;
- release-tool tests;
- packing/validation of all five public packages;
- local Markdown-link validation;
- workflow YAML parsing;
- focused rendered accessibility checks;
- changed-line whitespace validation.

Release packages #546 verified the exact-ref Release build/tests, all five packages, package metadata/dependencies, deterministic release notes, and artifact upload. NuGet publication and GitHub Release jobs remained skipped; no package, tag, or release was published.

This commit only records the resulting evidence/state. One final CI pass on the evidence-only head is required before changing PR #407 from Draft to review-ready.

Existing runtime evidence in `docs/compatibility/hosting-and-render-modes.md` verifies representative Drawer, Popover, Tooltip, Chart, Diagram, navigation, disposal, overlay, and DOM-measurement behavior in the named interactive modes. That evidence must not be generalized into component-wide/browser-wide accessibility guarantees.

## Current Operational Files

- `.bluent/HANDOFF.md` — immediate #406 continuation instructions.
- `.bluent/QUALITY.md` — validation vocabulary, baseline policy, and #406-specific gate.
- `docs/components/inventory.md` — current 65-family consumer retrieval ledger.
- `.agents/skills/bluent/SKILL.md` — portable skill entry point.
- `.agents/skills/bluent/COMPONENT-INDEX.md` — targeted family routing.
- `docs/components/consumer-api-surface.md` — non-component consumer API classification.
- `docs/ai/bluent-consumer-skill-dogfood.md` — dogfood scenario matrix.
- `docs/ai/issue-406-acceptance.md` — acceptance evidence audit.
- `docs/compatibility/hosting-and-render-modes.md` — runtime/render-mode evidence.

## Remaining #406 Work

1. Confirm Quality and Release-package workflows on this evidence-only head.
2. Refresh PR #407 with exact final-head workflow evidence and mark it review-ready if those checks pass.
3. Keep runtime-sensitive limitations explicitly bounded where browser evidence is absent.
4. Keep #411 open for product/API gaps found during or after the skill work.
5. Do not merge PR #407 or close #406 as part of the implementation task.

## Working Agreement

- Do not invent public APIs, support claims, render modes, assets, or accessibility behavior.
- Keep canonical docs authoritative and the consumer skill retrieval-oriented.
- Prefer Bluent components for user-facing interactive UI where Bluent has a suitable equivalent.
- Preserve public API consistency; product/API fixes discovered while documenting #406 require separate approval/work.
- Record validation at the evidence level actually exercised: source, build, test, pack, runtime, visual, or deployment.
- Update this file, `.bluent/HANDOFF.md`, the tracking issue, and PR when active project status materially changes.
- Do not merge, publish packages, tag/release, or close #406 unless separately instructed.

## Isolated Bluent v3 design track (not merged into stable v2.x)

As of 2026-10-10, Issue [#419](https://github.com/vrassouli/Bluent/issues/419) is **In progress** in GitHub Project #5, after its explicit `Backlog → Ready → In progress` transitions. Dedicated branch: `v3/issue-419-penpot-library`, **base `bluent-v3` only**. The maintainer created a separate Penpot `Bluent v3 Design System` file; twenty-seven native editable design pages (including foundation, brand, RTL, source reference and Button API anatomy), **134 verified upstream Fluent reference instances**, **four original local reusable draft components**, plus **five core native variant families / 65 unique variants and 65 linked local preview instances**, plus **two separate test-fixture families / 16 linked comparison and Persian RTL variants**, draft Light/Dark themes, **seven draft token sets / 49 entries**, and a local reusable primary Button prototype now exist. An actual linked imported Fluent 2 Button reference instance was verified and visually inspected, while the original community file remained unchanged. See [Penpot workspace contract](../docs/v3/design/BLUENT-V3-PENPOT.md), [extended foundations](../docs/v3/design/FOUNDATION-EXTENSIONS.md), [form/grid component references](../docs/v3/design/COMPONENT-REFERENCE-MATRICES.md), [local component drafts](../docs/v3/design/LOCAL-COMPONENT-DRAFTS.md), [native variant families](../docs/v3/design/NATIVE-CONTROL-VARIANTS.md), [native Button states/size/API design](../docs/v3/design/NATIVE-BUTTON-VARIANTS.md), [alignment audit + live Penpot gate](../docs/v3/design/ALIGNMENT-QUALITY-AUDIT.md), [actual imported/native Button comparison](../docs/v3/design/BUTTON-PARITY-REVIEW.md), [controlled copy/icon fidelity and Persian RTL](../docs/v3/design/BUTTON-CONTROLLED-FIDELITY-AND-RTL.md), [verified import-fidelity risk assessment](../docs/v3/design/PENPOT-IMPORT-FIDELITY.md), [source-to-Razor/CSS handoff contract](../docs/v3/design/DESIGN-TO-RAZOR-HANDOFF.md), [migration impact ledger](../docs/v3/design/MIGRATION-IMPACT-LEDGER.md), [native resize constraints lab](../docs/v3/design/BUTTON-RESIZE-REVIEW.md), [Button v2 API baseline checker](../scripts/quality/check_v3_button_api_baseline.py), [source-backed FC1–FC6 design gates](../docs/v3/design/FORM-CONTROL-DESIGN-GATES.md) and [machine-readable IDs](../docs/v3/design/penpot-workspace.manifest.json).

This draft does **not** approve the #417 styling ADR, implement the #418 CSS/token migration or satisfy full Fluent UI/design parity. No public v2/v3 component code, stable assets, `Dev`, published NuGet or deployment is modified. Complete library coverage, visual/interaction parity, accessibility, font/icon checks and design review remain before #419 reaches Review/Done.
